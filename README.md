This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

**This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production.
It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular 2**

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.



## Install npm packages

npm install

npm start


> If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after `npm install` please install them manually with:

> `npm run typings -- install`

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
